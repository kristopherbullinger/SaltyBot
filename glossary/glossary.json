Nitaku is Japanese for \"2 choices\", indicating the binary !<'50/50'> nature the defender finds himself in.

However, if you can generate enough !<'plus','plus frames'> (in VF5, +6 or higher is the !<'magic number'>), you can eliminate a lot of these defensive choices. To take the mid-or-throw example, a defender facing a nitaku would be left with a more or less binary guess; block the mid (and lose to throw), or try and attack so the throw doesn't work (and get !<'counter hit'> by the mid); picking any other defensive choice is very likely to lose to both offensive options.
